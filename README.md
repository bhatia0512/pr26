oreo cake
'Oreo cake' as the name is saying a cake made of oreo biscuits . It is my favourite sweet dish . Whenever  and wherever i see oreo cake my mouth start watering . If its made properly it looks so tempting on seeing only . It has double or single layer of oreo . It is very rich in chocolate and tastes very tasty when have some dry fruits on the top . At the last but not the least I only want to say that it is the best dish I have ever tasted .
